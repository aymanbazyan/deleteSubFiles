# deleteSubFiles

I made this Node.js script to delete unwanted subtitle files that are not in Arabic or English. It's easy to configure for other type of files if needed.

The script scans folders located in the current directory of the file and removes any file (inside the folders) that don't match the specified criteria.

Github didn't let me upload the compiled .exe run file, so run it using cmd or anything (Node required)
